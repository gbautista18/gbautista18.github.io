My friend is majoring in MIS and has told me about this major, so I deicded to look into it. I recently switched my major from accounting to MIS. I have decided that I wanted to pursue a career in the technology field and that I no longer want to pursure a career in accounting, which has led me to switch my major. I hope to pursue a career in program management. I think that majoring in MIS will be good for me because technology is always evolving and it is a great way to learn some basic technology skills in the field.
