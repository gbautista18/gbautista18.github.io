For this WOD I had to continue working and adding onto my previous smartphoneproducts by changing some of the information for the displays. This WOD took me two tries with an Rx time. I noticed that I do everything manually but I don't mind it, however I do know that there is an easier way to input the codes. Something that I will try different next time is doing the shortcut way instead of manually typing it myself because this will also help me to prevent any mistakes that may occur.

For this WOD I had to create a table that displays the product sales. It took me two tries to accomplish this WOD with an Av time. I referred back to the screencast video because I didn’t know how to do the table, and I also had to refer back to the readings to make sure I’m doing the equations correctly that are needed to calculate the totals. Something that I did similar to the previous WODs was whenever I got stuck I would refer back to the screencast videos to help me out.
